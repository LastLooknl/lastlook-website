									<p> <strong>1. Limited Access to Costumes: </strong>Many participants expressed frustration at the difficulty of obtaining costumes, which often requires connections to theatre schools or clubs. This creates barriers for individuals outside of these networks, making their ability to fully participate in theatrical productions difficult.</p> <p> <strong>2. Time-Consuming Search for Costumes: </strong>Participants highlighted the process of finding affordable costumes, often having to search through thrift stores and second-hand markets. This time-consuming endeavour is a source of frustration for those with limited time and resources.</p> <p> <strong>3. Ease of Finding Plays: </strong>Interestingly, the majority of participants did not report significant difficulties in finding plays to perform. With numerous scripts already available, an example being through their theatre club. Sourcing material for productions is not a major challenge</p> <p> <strong>4. Sustainability vs. Affordability Dilemma:</strong> Participants noted a common struggle between choosing sustainable options for costumes versus choosing for more affordable alternatives. Since our target group holds sustainability in high regard, balancing environmental concerns with budget constraints presents a dilemma for many theatre enthusiasts. This only highlights their need for an accessible and eco-friendly solution.</p>

								  <p> <span class="pipi">Penn red:</span> This colour evokes a sense of richness and elegance, which often get associated with the theatrical world. It adds a touch of sophistication to the website, making it appealing to users interested in vintage or high-quality clothing.</p> <p> <span class="pepep">Silver:</span> This light shade of grey is a neutral and versatile colour that complements darker shades such as the dark red-brown mentioned above.</p> <p> <span class="papap">Saffron:</span> This colour adds a pop of warmth and vibrancy to the website. Golden yellow is often associated with creativity, positivity, and energy, all of which align well with the artistic and expressive nature of theatre.</p> <p>White: This is clean, fresh, and timeless. It creates a sense of space and openness, allowing the clothing items to be showcased prominently. White backgrounds are commonly used in e-commerce websites as they provide a neutral canvas that doesn't distract from the products being sold.</p> <p> Black: Provides contrast and emphasis. It can be used for text, buttons, or borders to make important elements stand out against lighter backgrounds. In the context of a vinted-like website for theatre clothes, black adds a touch of drama and sophistication, echoing the theatrical theme.</p> <p> Overall, this colour palette creates a visually appealing and cohesive aesthetic for the website, enhancing the user experience and encouraging engagement with the second-hand theatre clothing offerings.</p>
									<h4 class="item-intro text-muted">Typography</h4>
									<h3>HEADER</h3> <p> Montserrat is known for its bold and attention-grabbing appearance. It has thick strokes and strong, heavy letters that make it stand out. We want our header to have a strong visual impact and demand attention. Despite its boldness, Montserrat remains relatively easy to read, especially in larger sizes.</p>
									<p> SUBHEADER and BODY</p> <p>Roboto Slab is designed with readability in mind. Its clean and well-proportioned which makes it easy to read even when used in smaller sizes. While having a distinct look, it maintains a level of versatility that makes it suitable for a wide range of applications. For this reason we felt comfortable using it for both the body and subheader text.</p>
								  <h4 class="item-intro text-muted">Logo</h4> 
									<img src="assets/img/logolastlook.png" width="159" height="88" alt="logo"> <p>We've designed our logo in our signature dark red colour, emphasising our commitment to the theatrical world. By incorporating the iconic theatre masks, we ensure instant recognition of our brand's focus on theatre. The surrounding arrows symbolise our dedication to sustainability. Through our logo, we proudly showcase our values and style.</p>
									<h4 class="item-intro text-muted">Imagery</h4> <p> We'll have homemade images displayed on our website because individuals will be posting their own costumes. We allow images with or without a person trying on the costumes offers flexibility to our users. Some may prefer to showcase their costumes solely, emphasising their craftsmanship, while others may opt to include photos of themselves wearing the costumes to demonstrate fit and styling. By accommodating both options, we cater to a wider range of preferences and needs, ultimately enhancing the user experience on our platform.</p>
									<h4 class="item-intro text-muted">Brand Story</h4> <p>LastLook was born out of a simple yet profound realisation: the theatre community deserves better. Too often, passionate performers and theatre enthusiasts struggle with the high cost and limited availability of quality costumes. Many are forced to resort to expensive solutions or spend countless hours crafting their own. Determined to address this pressing need, we set out on a mission to create easy access to theatre costumes. We envisioned a platform where affordability and creativity could coexist – where anyone, regardless of budget or skill level, could find the perfect costume for their next performance. With Last Look, we're not just selling costumes; we're rewriting the script on theatrical accessibility. Our goal is simple: to empower the theatre community by providing them with the tools and resources they need to bring their creative visions to life.</p>
									<h4 class="item-intro text-muted">Voice</h4> <p>At Last Look, we strike a balance between relatability and professionalism, catering to our target groups preferences. Our tone is casual and inclusive, using slang when appropriate to connect personally. Yet, we're also knowledgeable and confident, delivering clear, concise communication that creates trust. Our voice is both relatable and professional, empowering our audience while showcasing our expertise.</p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">Context</h2>
                                    <p>LastLook has embarked on a groundbreaking campaign aimed at changing the world of theater by attending to a community that stands for creativity, sustainability, and inclusivity. We envision a world where theater performers and creators have the ultimate creative freedom to express themselves without limitations. Our platform serves as a beacon for theater enthusiasts, offering a seamless and accessible solution for the exchange of second-hand costumes. With Last Look, we aim to create a global community where every theater enthusiast can unleash their imagination, celebrate collaboration, and contribute to a more sustainable future for the performing arts.</p> <p>Through our platform, we aspire to provide a marketplace for the buying and selling of costumes that also creates connections within the theater community. By facilitating the exchange of pre-loved costumes, we aim to reduce waste and promote a culture of upcycling, where every garment finds new life on the stage.</p> <p>Our target demographic comprises 18 to 25-year-old theater players struggling with the challenges of sourcing and disposing of costumes. To gain insights into their social media habits, we conducted a survey. This survey (Microsoft Forms - Free Tool to Create Online Surveys, Forms, Polls, and Quizzes, n.d.) questioned their platform preferences, usage duration, timing, location, and intended purposes. Findings indicate that Instagram and TikTok are the most used platforms, making them optimal channels for promotional activities.</p> <p> On these platforms, we made relatable, attention-grabbing, and humorous content by tapping into current trends. According to Moursi (2023), “Gen Z wants to see authentic, funny, and relatable content. Some values that resonate with Gen Z are authenticity, connection, community, and self-expression.”  On Instagram, we accomplished creating funny and relatable content by showing memes and outfit inspirations. Our target group can relate to the memes, due to the jokes being from the audience's perspective. The outfit inspiration idea was used because this type of content is well received on other accounts. For this reason, our brand incorporated this trend with a personal touch. Instead of regular day to day outfits, our brand showed inspiration for multiple different roles. For example, the role of Regina in the musical Mean Girls, and the roles of Donna and Sophie in the musical Mamma Mia. The content of these posts were based on the viewers’ recommendations by leaving a poll in the comments and asking what theater play they would like to see an outfit inspiration for next. We did this because we wanted the audience to feel involved and create a sense of community. On Tiktok, we mainly posted content that was trending, funny and relatable. To incorporate the feeling of authenticity as well, our brand posted ‘Get ready with me’ videos, in which theater players share their stories. These were posted on both Tiktok as well as Instagram. We can conclude that the type of content we created aligns perfectly with our target group.</p> <p>Our values also connect with theirs, which makes our brand ideal for them. To make our target group instantly aware of our brand's values, our company included posts that shared these beliefs in a clear and impactful way. On Instagram for instance, we included quotes such as; “Sell. Buy. Perform.” This quote shows the accessibility and convenience that our brand strives to have while also encouraging performance as this is the ultimate goal for every theater player. Another quote that was included said; “Circle with us”, this quote was combined with visuals that showed the endless sustainable circle costumes can go on with our website. Including this quote instantly makes our target group aware of our value for sustainability. The last value incorporated on our Instagram account was; “Unlock your Vision, Play your Part”, which resonates with our goal of giving theater players the ultimate creative freedom. It shows that the vision you have for a role and costume can come to life with Lastlook.The values of our brand were shared on TikTok as well, however in this case it was combined with an ongoing trend of saying; “This is your sign to…”, in our case it said; “This is your sign to sign up for Lastlook”, with slides after that mentioning our values of convenience, affordability, community cultivation, and creative freedom. </p> <p> In addition to sharing our brand values, we also featured more informative content on Instagram. For example, the explanation of the buying and selling process. In this post a slideshow with three easy steps made clear what our product was and how to use it. Our primary objective with all of these posts was to stay relevant to our target audience and blend in with their existing interests. </p>

									<h2 class="text-uppercase">Learning points</h2>
                                    <p>LastLook's marketing strategy focuses on making use of Instagram and TikTok to maximise brand awareness and engagement among our target audience. Our objectives were especially made to ensure that we effectively reached and resonated with our audience on both platforms. Reflecting on our campaign journey, we've learned lessons about effective audience engagement, content strategy and utilising the features of the platforms. While certain aspects of our strategy have resulted in positive results, we've also encountered challenges and areas for improvement.</p> <p>Unfortunately, we did not reach our goal to reach 500 accounts on Instagram. Initially, our account performed well, surpassing the desired number of likes. However, our reach gradually declined, resulting in fewer interactions. Additionally, we received minimal comments, which we related to not achieving our targeted account reach. </p> <p>Additionally, we've learned the significance of maintaining a consistent presence on both platforms by increasing our posting frequency. Currently, we post every Wednesday and Friday evenings. According to Ghatak (2024), posting in the evening is still beneficial. However, by increasing our posting frequency, we could potentially reach a wider audience. Sharing content with our audience more regularly would enable us to drive higher levels of engagement over time.</p> <p> Another takeaway has been the importance of maximising platform features to diversify our content and engage our audience. We have mainly been using pictures, a reel and a few interactive stories. But were we to post more reels, stories and highlights we would be a much more active account that would attract more accounts.</p> <p>Another thing which did not go as planned is that in the last 1 and a half weeks due to the workload of this project as well as other projects we were not able to post on social media. This also might have been a consequence of us not reaching the goal. In the future this could be prevented by better planning and better time and team management. </p> <p>We embraced experimentation which has been a success in our marketing campaign. We've used various kinds of content, including an informative video, memes, instructions, and outfit inspiration. We’ve kept up with current trends, especially on TikTok and received a lot of positive feedback because of this. This approach has been the key to keeping our content fresh and engaging.</p> <p>Moving forward, we're committed to grow after learning these lessons. By further refining our content strategy, maximising platform features, and increasing posting frequency, we aim to deliver even greater value and engagement to our audience on Instagram and TikTok.</p> <br>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">Future Planning</h2>
                                  <p><strong>Reflection:</strong><br>For future planning we are looking at what our audience has enjoyed in the past and combining this with the current trends and popular elements. When looking at past content we can conclude a few things. Firstly let’s analyze Tik Tok. The first thing we can conclude is that our audience enjoys humor. On tik tok content including humor gained more interactions such as likes, comments and saves, than other posts. We can also conclude that our audience enjoys relatable and real content. We can see this with the ‘get ready with me’ video. This video received more comments than any video. The comments were about the person in the video. You can conclude from this that a real storytime allows the audience to relate or even look up to this person. When content did not do very well on Tiktok, it was mainly due to content lacking visuals. Content that was not very engaging visually did not do well compared to others. When looking at Instagram, we can once again see the ‘get ready with me’ video doing well, which is both relatable, and at the time trendy. Other trendy content like a meme that was trending at the time did well, and quotes did well. What we can conclude from this is that the audience on tiktok enjoy humor, relatable and real content. And the audience on Instagram enjoy relatable and trendy content, and quotes. Now that we have this data we can look into what the future content will look like. Like mentioned before, the future content will be based on past data. <br> <a href="assets/img/corporate/redocontent planning.xlsx">Find our Content Planner here.</a> </p> 
									<p><strong>Explanation and justification Instagram:</strong> <br> As we know our Instagram audience enjoys relatable and trendy content, and quotes, we are continuing with that in the future. For relatable content more ‘get ready with me’ videos will be posted. For trendy content we are continuing with trendy memes and adding trendy words, phrases, or events into the quotes, this also adds a sense of relatability. We are also continuing with quotes but making them less generic and more trendy and funny as that is what the audience enjoys. Like mentioned in the learning points, to add new things we have decided to maximize and use the Instagram features more by using the stories option and live stream options. We will be adding polls about favorite theater plays or theater actors to increase engagement. Live streams will occur to add more of a personal touch. The creators of Lastlook will go live to form more of a personal bond with the audience and well known actors will go live on Lastlook’s Instagram platforms to reach more people.</p>
									<p><strong>Explanation and justification Tiktok:</strong> <br> As mentioned, the Tiktok audience enjoys humor, relatable and real content, and highly visual content. To continue with the funny content we will combine current funny trends and combine that with Lastlook content. For the relatable and real content we will do this in a variety of ways such as storytimes, get ready and unready with me where people get to know that person, behind the scenes of a theater player and game videos where people's personality shine through. This variety of real and relatable content will engage the audience and keep the audience as they get to know the people (us, theater players, well known theater players) more and more. We will make all this content highly visually attractive by quick camera movements, editing, bright colors, and not too long videos. The Tiktok content of Lastlook in the future will be more diverse allowing the audience to be more engaged and hopefully reaching more people. </p>

                                    <p> <strong> Problem:</strong> In the first iteration, LastLook was going to be a platform where multiple problems of the theatre community would be solved. But after careful consideration and hearing from our target group, we decided to focus solely on the problem surrounding costumes.</p> <p> <strong>Solution:</strong> LastLook offers an innovative solution by providing easy and fast access to second-hand costumes, offering a cheaper alternative for theatre players while promoting sustainability by repurposing costumes for multiple uses. This platform also makes buying and selling of costumes efficient and affordable, ensuring that cherished costumes find new life in captivating plays. </p> <p><strong>Key Metrics:</strong> Key metrics for LastLook haven’t changed and include daily website visitors, weekly app downloads, and monthly products posted and sold on the platform.</p> <p> <strong> Unique Value Proposition:</strong> LastLook's unique value proposition still lies in offering a one-stop platform for theatre players where they can seamlessly buy and sell costumes. Specialising in theatre-related clothing, LastLook understands the unique needs and preferences of its target audience, providing a competitive advantage.</p> <p> <strong>Channels:</strong> LastLook leverages social media platforms such as Instagram and TikTok to reach its target audience and promote its platform effectively. These are the platforms that our target audience uses regularly and we can reach them through.</p> <p> <strong> Customer Segments:</strong> LastLook caters primarily to amateur theatre players aged 18-24 with limited budgets, a passion for theatre, and a desire for affordable costumes. These customers are resourceful and seek access to affordable solutions for their theatrical needs.</p> <p> <strong> Cost Structure:</strong> The cost structure for LastLook still includes expenses related to website and app development, as well as advertising costs to promote the platform.</p> <p> <strong>Revenue Streams:</strong> LastLook still generates revenue primarily through advertising on its platform, leveraging its user base and engagement to attract advertisers and generate income.</p>

                                  <p>In this final Lean Canvas, the majority remained the same. However, we've recognized a potential limitation in relying solely on advertising revenue to cover costs and generate profit. As a result, we've decided to introduce selling fees and shipping costs. This means that when users sell their costumes on LastLook, a percentage of their profit will go to the platform. Additionally, buyers will be responsible for covering shipping costs, and will therefore not be the responsibility of LastLook. </p>

									<h4>Validation of assumption</h4>
									<p>When choosing the trademark we wanted our logo and colour palette to immediately represent our product. When starting off with our colour palette, we wanted to have the traditional feel of theatre which is a darker red. We decided to build our colour palette around this red colour. We decided to add colours that complemented the red, and we wanted a colour that represented our target audience. We chose yellow as it stands for creativity and positivity. After choosing our colour palette we could begin to think out and design our logo. We had made multiple versions of it but we were unsure which fitted the best. We decided to do a test round where we showed people all the logos and asked per logo what they thought it was meant to represent and what kind of product and target audience would be linked to it. After these test rounds we had a much better perspective of what feelings our logos evoked, and based on this, and our own input, we chose our logo. During this process we had many other ideas. We had thought about scrapping the idea of the traditional theatre colours and not including the theatre illustration in our logo. After the testing and further research we had decided not to proceed further with these ideas as we did not feel as though it represented our product nor did it give the feel we had imagined. </p> <p> When looking at existing alternatives, Vinted is a big one. That being said there are many components that differentiate Vinted to Lastlook. Firstly LastLook focuses solely on costumes while Vinted focuses on all different types of clothing. In a world of fast paced choices, little time, and a lot to do, searching through thousands of clothing items that are not labelled and meant to be costumes is not ideal. In comparison to Vinted, LastLook is specialised in costumes. Meaning the costumes are meant to be danced, sung, moved, and jumped in. Earlier owners of the costumes have used, tested, and sometimes even made these pieces ensuring it is theatre proof. Additionally no time is wasted as the only clothes provided are costumes, allowing for faster searches and more easy finding, meaning no time is wasted.</p> <p>From interviews and research it was concluded that many theatre players and teams find their costumes on websites like Shein or Aliexpress, this is due to the fact that costumes on here are very affordable, which is what students with a limited amount of money are looking for. The downside to websites like these is that it is not sustainable at all. These websites promote fast fashion which is known to be wasteful and these clothes have a short life span. Theatre players are forced to choose between affordability and sustainability and LastLooks solves this dilemma.</p> <p>Another existing alternative is the website Theatermarkt. This website connects buyers and sellers of second hand theatre costumes. On the website you can buy and hire theatre costumes. What differentiates Lastlook and Theatermarkt is that we specifically chose to not incorporate hiring as this causes a delay in time which we found out through interviews and research is not ideal in the world of theatre. On top of that, on many products on this website you can suggest a price which also results in additional waiting time. On theatermarkt a lot of contact is required before actually hiring or buying the product which we believe is not ideal. Additionally we believe we differ from Theatermarkt through the layout and feel of our product. Our product has a different layout, colour palette and feel which allows it to be more straightforward and allows easier use. </p>

                                    <h2 class="text-uppercase">Design Elements</h2>
									<p> During the development of the LastLook website, we followed our established style guide, ensuring that the chosen fonts and colours align with our brand identity. Our primary colours, red, black, and grey, are prominently featured throughout the website, with red serving as our primary colour and black and grey used for headers, subheads, and body text. These design choices were purposefully made to reflect the energetic and professional essence of our brand, as outlined in our marketing strategy.</p> <p> The homepage boasts a visually captivating grid layout, showcasing a high-quality image with a theatre theme, accompanied by a welcoming message and clear call-to-action buttons. Visitors are seamlessly guided to explore more about how the website works with the "Tell Me More" button, ensuring an engaging and user-friendly experience that aligns with our vision and mission.</p> <p> Central to our design approach was the emphasis on symmetry and simplicity. The layout is centred in the middle, ensuring that text and icons were aligned in a visually appealing manner. Where necessary, content was divided into groups of three squares, providing a professional and organised presentation, particularly evident in pop-ups used on the sell and corporate page. By using these pop-ups we were able to have large amounts of text on our website without it taking away from the overall aesthetic.</p> <p> The navigation bar was thoughtfully structured to showcase the most essential sections of our website, including "Buy," "Sell," "About Us," and "Corporate," providing intuitive access for visitors. Each section was labelled with familiar terminology, ensuring ease of use and navigation for our target audience.</p> <p>Consistency was key in creating a cohesive layout throughout the website. Text, images, and icons are centred to uphold a professional aesthetic. Pop-ups were strategically grouped in sets of three to maintain a professional appearance across the site.</p> <p>Given that one of our values is ‘inclusive access’, this aligns perfectly with our consistent use of easy accessibility throughout the website. As for the personality of the brand, we marketed in a certain casual way because this is what our target audience is attracted to. However, during the website development phase, we opted for simplicity as we knew that this is preferred by users because of the ease to operate it. This is what we as a brand stand for as well in terms of personality and how we want to communicate our brand to the public. We want to make the process of finding costumes easier. For us, that starts with the structure of our website. </p>

                                    <h4> Testing goals</h4>
									<p> 1. <strong>Understanding Company Values:</strong> Assessing whether users can identify what is important to our company and if our core values are effectively communicated through the website. <br> 2. <strong> Employee Visibility:</strong> Determining if it's clear who works for the company and if the website effectively showcases team members. <br> 3.<strong> Social Media Integration:</strong> Evaluating if users can easily access the company's Instagram and TikTok accounts from the website, ensuring seamless integration with social media platforms. <br> 4. <strong> E-commerce Functionality: </strong>Assessing the ease of purchasing items directly from the website, including navigating product pages and completing the checkout process. <br> 5. <strong> Account Creation:</strong> Determining if users can easily create an account on the website, which is essential for making purchases.<br> <br> Overall, the goals focus on understanding user perception to ensure a positive user experience and alignment with our business objectives.</p>
									<h4>Testing methods</h4>
									<p>The goal of testing of the website was for it to be done in a quiet environment since that would keep the testers attention focused on the website. The specific setting differs since all four members did these tests at different times and places. The website was shown either on a laptop for optimal quality or on a mobile phone. <br> All participants were first given an introduction to the problem we wanted to solve. Then we explained the purpose of the website. They were also all informed that we were going to ask them to execute a series of actions on our website and explain what they think of the process. After this, we started asking our questions. <br>
									
										    <br> - What’s your name?
											<br> - How long have you been playing theatre for?
											<br> - What do you think is important to our company?
											<br> - Is it clear who works for the company?
											<br> - Can you go to the company's Instagram/TikTok account?
											<br> - Can you buy an item that’s on the site?
											<br> - Can you create an account?</p>
									<h4>Findings</h4>
									<p> <strong>Positive aspects of UI/UX:</strong><br>
										- In general it’s a user friendly website <br>
										- The entire website looks simplistic and clear <br>
										- There are not too many headers or links to click on at once <br>
										- Easy to navigate and spend a longer time on <br>
										- The placing of elements on the website was well organised and how they would expect a website to be organised<br>
										- It’s easy to see where the main topics (buy, sell, etc.) can be found in the navigation bar, partly of easy naming of the buttons <br>
										- The explained values fit with their own <br>
										- The ‘buy’ page has big images of the costumes which is easier and more clear than having to click on a smaller image to view it. This is common in other shopping websites.<br>
										- The initial page is fun and the image speaks to the target group. <br>
										- Making an account is relatively easy and is portrayed nicely <br>
										- The icons in ‘about us’ give a clear indication of what you’ll find and where <br>
										- The social media platforms were easy to find <br>
										- The background is calm which takes the focus to what matters<br>
										- It was obvious to the user who the employees of the brand are</p>
									<p> <strong>Negative aspects of UI/UX:</strong><br>
										- When asked to create an account it was difficult, because you have to go to sell instead of a tab to create an account <br>
										- There is no cart on the website<br>
										- The navigation bar is difficult to see on the white pages<br>
										- In the ‘corporate’ pop-ups there are only large amounts of text which makes it boring. <br>
										- The icons of the ‘’how does it work?’ page are not clickable.<br></p>
										<p><strong> (Potential) improvements:</strong> <br>
											<em>1. Create a ‘create account’ button in the navigation bar</em><br>
											Adding a 'Create Account' button in the navigation bar enhances user experience by providing a clear and direct call-to-action for users who want to sign up or register on the website. Placing it in the navigation bar ensures that users can easily find and access the account creation process from any page and encourages engagement with the platform.</p>
									<p> <em>2. Make the navigation bar readable on all pages</em><br>
										Ensuring that the navigation bar is readable on all pages is crucial. A clear navigation bar allows users to quickly locate and access different sections of the website, improving usability and reducing frustration. By maintaining consistency in design and layout across all pages, users can seamlessly navigate the website, enhancing their overall experience and facilitating efficient interaction with the content.</p>
									<p><em>3. Add icons to the corporate pages to make the large amounts of text less boring and more easy to read such as in ‘about us’. </em><br>
										Incorporating icons into corporate pages, such as in the 'About Us' section, serves to break up large blocks of text, making the content more visually appealing and easier to digest. Icons can visually represent key concepts or topics, providing visual cues that make the text more interesting. By enhancing readability the addition of icons enhances user engagement and ensures that users can absorb the content more effectively.</p>
									<p> <em>4. Add a cart in the corner </em><br>
										Adding a cart icon in the corner of the website provides users with quick access to their shopping cart. By prominently displaying the cart icon, users are reminded of items they have added to their cart, encouraging them to proceed to checkout and complete their purchase. They can also view their items at all times. This convenience improves the overall shopping experience and increases user satisfaction.</p>
